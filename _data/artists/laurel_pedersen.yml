blurb: |
  Laurel is a visual and ceramic artist living in West Grey, Ontario. She paints primarily in watercolour and is exploring the acrylic medium. Inspired by the Bruce Trail and her garden (Reties Garden), many of her paintings are expressive interpretations of nature. However, she finds the juxtaposition of architecture and natural environments equally compelling.

  Laurel’s work in clay ceramics is a new passion. Her work produces unique textures and organic shapes while striving to retain functionality. You’re invited to visit her website [www.retiesgarden.ca](http://www.retiesgarden.ca) to see more of her work or consider a workshop for you and your friends.
