blurb: >
  I first joined a painting club in 2012 with the idea that supporting
  such a group by contributing a yearly membership fee would help to
  create a strong, vital presence of artists in the Grey Highlands
  community of Flesherton. This would let me dabble with a variety
  of mediums, while assuring myself that “I was there to enjoy the
  camaraderie of a group of creative and stimulating individuals and
  just to play at art”. No pressure. Two years later, I was enticed
  enough by acrylic and pastel mediums to admit that I was a serious
  pupil of the arts.

  Living just west of Flesherton, in the Beaver Valley, offers me
  endless tableaux. The lure of re-creating, in paint and pastels,
  droplets of sunshine splashed on snowy landscapes, wind stirred trees
  of autumn hue partly obscuring a cottage or azure waters blending to
  deep turquoise as they tumble between tossed rocks take me outdoors
  to capture nature’s vignettes with brushes to canvas.
