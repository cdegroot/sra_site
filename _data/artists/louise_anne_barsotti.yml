  For many years I have used oils, acrylics and pastels to paint portraits of models in classes or of photographs of strangers.  What makes this series of portraits special to me is that they are all members of Split Rail Artists, a group with whom I have painted for a few years.

  There has developed a camaraderie and mutual affection amongst us as we paint together.  I have tried to capture the life and laughter of my painting friends in watercolour, a new medium for me.  It has been a very pleasurable learning experience.

  My husband and I live in Grey Highlands with our haywire terror-er, wire haired terrier, Toby.
