blurb: |
  Dianne works from her home in Ceylon, Ontario and is currently working
  in acrylic paint with an emphasis on texture. Always learning and
  experimenting, her adventures into art have led to a fulfilling
  life. She willingly encourages others to create. Dianne's paintings
  invite contemplation whether it be Bruce trail scenes, water, wildlife,
  flowers, birds or cows.
