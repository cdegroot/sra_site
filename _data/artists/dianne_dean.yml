blurb: >
  Many years ago, Dianne picked up a paint-by-numbers kit and proceeded to use the paint inside to complete an original piece. Dianne’s ability may have come from her grandfather, whose work she greatly admired (and still does). While a career librarian, and avid reader, Dianne studied various painting schools, methods and applications, taking classes in her quest to improve her sketching and painting.

  Capturing realistic landscapes in oil, acrylic, or watercolours is her mainstay. Ontario’s Bruce Trail continues to provide unlimited subject material. - “If I can feel myself walk into one of my paintings, I know I have painted well”.

  Dianne has exhibited her work with numerous group shows and two person shows. She enjoys teaching art to children and helping adults learn basic skills and has previously conducted art classes.
