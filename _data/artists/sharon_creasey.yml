blurb: >
  I moved to the Flesherton area 11 years ago with my husband and pets and have never regretted the move to the country.  I have been doing ceramics for 25 years.  I have this love of animals to want to make them look life like.  The best compliment I receive is when people say they look real.  I do many garden items as well as Christmas pieces.  You can find me at the Flesherton Farmer's Market for the summer.  I joined the Splitrail Artists group just over a year ago as a total novice and am enjoying it very much.  One day soon I hope to finish painting some pictures as well.
