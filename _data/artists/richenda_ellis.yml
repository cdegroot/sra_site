blurb: |
  Richenda has enjoyed drawing and being creative all her life. She is self-taught.

  Her love of pen & ink started after she was given a Rotary (Isograph) pen at the age of 12. Richenda has drawn many subjects including ducks, steam trains, wild boar and mice; her style is light-hearted and cartoonish.

  Richendaâ€™s repertoire also includes lino prints, wire sculpture, pencil drawing and, more recently needle felting combined with machine embroidery.
