  For me, the joy of pottery making came later in my life, after making the move from Toronto to Collingwood. Passing by an old barn one day, I noticed a sign advertising pottery classes. I signed up and the results from these classes were a disaster, but I was hooked and have been enjoying the craft ever since, and thankfully with much practice improving my skills. I work with stoneware clay, throwing on the wheel as well as doing hand building, and decorate with painted designs and glazes. I create mostly functional pieces, in hopes that people will use and enjoy them on a daily basis.

  The old barn in Anten Mills, where my first classes took place, houses the studio that I share with four other potters.
