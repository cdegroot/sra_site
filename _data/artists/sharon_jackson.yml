      <p>Sharon Jackson grew up in the east end of Toronto and moved to Grey County in the early 70â€™s. &nbsp;She and her husband still share the 140 year old farmhouse they purchased back then.&nbsp; Their entire family calls it home.</p>
      <p>Sharon is an avid gardener but when the weather turns she picks up her brushes and paints. &nbsp;Animals and people are her favourite subjects, animals being the most accepting of her work!</p>
