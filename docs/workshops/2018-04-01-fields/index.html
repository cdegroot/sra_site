<p><img src="../fields.jpg" alt="Fields" /></p>

<p>Who the heck wants to spend days painting fields when there’s seemingly nothing there, I’d rather contemplate my belly button. If you can visualize past your blinders you’ll learn how to see and paint some of the most stunning paintings with fields as the centre of focus. Exciting fun and fast techniques that will add to your mastery of landscape painting. You will also improve your good looks (as in observation skills). Not good looking ? - then you better take this course.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your paints</li>
  <li>A canvas</li>
  <li>Brushes</li>
  <li>$90.00 (non member price is $100.00) total cost for two class days. Cash or cheque payable to Split Rail Artists.</li>
</ul>
