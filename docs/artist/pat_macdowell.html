    <p>Born in Glasgow, Scotland Pat has since lived in Montreal, Oakville, Newburgh (near Kingston) and now lives in Durham. All of these places have been significant to Pat's artistic development.  Her parents were both artistic and encouraged her endeavours at a young age.   <p> After her marriage she moved to Montreal where she started painting in oils, copying some of the old masters such as John Constable and many others.  She was encouraged to take art lessons and did so with an extraordinary teacher whose lessons she now passes on to her students.   <p> Another teacher, this time using watercolours became her mentor in Oakville.  As  a member of the Oakville Art Society she participated in many juried art shows and had paintings hanging in several art galleries both in Quebec and Ontario.   <p> Her philosophy is - Creativity makes our spirits dance no matter what we are creating, be it music, art, gardening or cooking, so keep on creating and dancing.
