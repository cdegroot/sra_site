We are a group of painters, sketchers, and dreamers who enjoy getting together to produce creative art in various mediums.  Our group meets at the Flesherton Legion on Wednesdays from 10 to 2, and the day is filled with lots of imagination, learning, helping and downright wacky fun.  Everyone is very approachable and we have all levels of skills.  If you think you would like to check us out or join the group these are the ways you can participate.

* Paint, sketch, etc. with us on Wednesdays at the Legion in Flesherton.
* Become a member ($30.00 per year).
* Participate in a workshop (fee extra).
* Show your work at one or more of our organized shows (eg. Canada Day weekend show,  Feversham,ON, Flesherton Fling group exhibit in August and a November December show at the library).
